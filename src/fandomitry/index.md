A place where I'll put all my gushing about the stuff I like. I'll recommend stuff here and be a bit too excited about them. As said before, I do what I want. Some of these may require trigger warnings, so scroll forward and click on things with caution.

Why is this called ***fandomitry*** instead of an actual word? Well I combined the words "Fandom" and "Observatory" and got that, and I thought that it fit.
