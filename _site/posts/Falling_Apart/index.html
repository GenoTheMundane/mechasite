        <h1>Falling Apart</h1>
          <hr>
<p>I think I am falling apart, I miss the way you look at me. The way you smiled when I wasn't there to see. I feel sick when I see you, how you walk over the black dahlias that I grew for someone else, the way you read the books that I loved makes me feel like my organs have been torn off.</p>
<p>I ask you why you watch me at night and why you haunt me in mirrors that I broke. You laugh and brush off my questions. I asked why you planted dandelions in my garden, and you shrugged it off. I hate you. You planted weeds in my heart.</p>
<p>I see the way you gutted the sheep that I raised, they never wanted to be a part of this. Their soft white fleece, stained and hardened by the blood that you spilled on them. I heard their bleats of pain, but I couldn't help them. I was busy putting up the horseshoes that you left hanging upside down.</p>
<p>You wanted a reaction out of me, but my reaction was in the presence of a blank face. You wanted me to scream and shout, but I couldn't. You saw the clothes that I was drying, and you burned them to try and help me.</p>
<p>You made everything worse. You made me worse. You stare at me and beg for forgiveness, but that isn't what I wanted. I wanted to see you on your knees, I want you to sacrifice your heart and serve it to me on a platter. You say that you are sorry, but I know that you are lying.</p>
